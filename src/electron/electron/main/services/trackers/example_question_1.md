### TASK
Generate a question based on the given intent and context.

### OUTPUT
Respond with an array of JSON objects with the following format:
- rationale: a short rationale for your question, e.g. why this question makes sense given the intent and the context.
- question: the detailed question, containing relevant information from the context.
- title: a summary of the question (max. 10 words), formulated as question and ending with a question mark.
- usefulness: a number between 0 and 100 indicating how useful the question is based on the given intent and context.
