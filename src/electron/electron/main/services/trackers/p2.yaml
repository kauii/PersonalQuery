### TASK
You are an expert software developer.
Determine what the developer is trying to achieve based on the given context.

### STEPS
1. Let's think step by step.
2. Explain your rationale, and ignore information that is not software development related.

### RULES
1. Formulate goal and summary as concise as possible from the developer's perspective.

### OUTPUT
Respond with a JSON object with the following format:
- rationale: a short rationale for your prediction, e.g. why you think this is the goal
- goal: a five word summary of the detected goal
- summary: a summary of the context relevant for the detected goal
- confidence: a number between 0 and 100 indicating your confidence of predicting the correct goal
